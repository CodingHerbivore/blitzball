# blitzball

This classic game is the first project in the book BlitzMax for Absolute Beginners. 
Hit space to serve the ball, use the mouse to move the paddle back and forth. Escape key quits. 

# Known bug

Unfortunately, the book was written about the original BlitzMax, and not BlitzMax NG. The latter won't allow the "GoTo" that the author uses when ending the game after all the lives are used, so I need to find a workaround. For now, lives simply run into the negatives.
